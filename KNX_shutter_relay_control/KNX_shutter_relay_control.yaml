blueprint:
  name: KNX shutter management via ordinary relay actor
  description: Able to manage shutter up and down movement as well as stop shutter. Created for H8I8O module 
that controlls relays.
  domain: automation
  input:
    virtual_long_ga:
      name: Virtual Long Group Address (GA)
      description: This is the group address you will use to control the long movement of the shutter by 
sending binary 1 (close) or 0 (open).
    virtual_short_ga:
      name: Virtual Short Group Address (GA)
      description: This is the group address you will use to control the long movement of the shutter by 
sending binary 1 (move up) or 0 (move down).
    virtual_stop_ga:
      name: Virtual Stop Group Address (GA)
      description: This is the group address you will use to stop the movement by sending binary 1 (stop).
    down_ga:
      name: Downward Group Address
      description: This is the group address used to control downward movement of the shutter. Binary 1 turns 
on the movement and 0 turns it off.
    up_ga:
      name: Upward Group Address
      description: This is the group address used to control upward movement of the shutter. Binary 1 turns 
on the movement and 0 turns it off.
    long_time_open:
      name: Long movement time to open (seconds)
      description: This is the time needed for the shutter to fully open.
    long_time_close:
      name: Long movement time to close (seconds)
      description: This is the time needed for the shutter to fully close.
    short_time_open:
      name: Short movement time to open (milliseconds)
      description: This is the time needed for the shutter to step once to open.
    short_time_close:
      name: Short movement time to close (milliseconds)
      description: This is the time needed for the shutter to step once to close.
